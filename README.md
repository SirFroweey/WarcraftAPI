# WarcraftAPI
A simple module used to showcase basic python fundamentals and basic RESTful API capabilities.

This module is not fully-functional, in the sense that all of Battle.net's API capabilities are showcased. Rather, basic functionality is showcased, displaying python fundamentals in clean-code design and methologies.

## Functionality
If you execute the WarcraftAPI.py python file, you'll notice it will pull all of the World of Warcraft realms and convert them into python **Server** objects.
